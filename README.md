A lovely wrong fork() example in C


Your mission is to fix this wayward example of the fork system call.  
That includes fixing errors and bugs, but also coding style, comments, or lack of comments, etc.  
Your final code must correctly compile with gcc 4.9.1, without warnings, with the following command exactly:

```bash
gcc -Wall -o fork.out fork1.c
```

ubmit your completed work as a pull request to this repository before the Fall 2014 Equinox. March 20, 2014
